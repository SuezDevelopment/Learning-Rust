Learning Rust - Backend RESTful API Development
==========
# rust_api: A Rust-based RESTful API

This project implements a RESTful API using Rust.  It leverages [Ollama](https://ollama.org/) for large language model (LLM) interaction and PostgreSQL for persistent data storage.

## Functionality

The API provides endpoints for:

* **Generating text:**  Uses the integrated Ollama client to send prompts to an LLM and return generated text.  Various parameters (temperature, max tokens) control the generation process.
* **Database Interaction:**  Connects to a PostgreSQL database for data persistence (CRUD operations).

## Architecture

The application is structured as follows:

* **Ollama Integration (`ollama.rs`):** Handles communication with the Ollama API for LLM interaction.  This module provides an abstraction layer for interacting with the LLM, allowing for easy switching between models if needed.

* **PostgreSQL Integration:**  (Implementation details to be added).  Manages database connections and performs database operations.  This includes handling database connections, executing queries, and processing results.  Consideration is given to connection pooling for efficiency.

* **API Endpoints:** (Implementation details to be added). Defines and implements the RESTful endpoints using a suitable framework (e.g., Actix Web). Each endpoint handles requests, interacts with the Ollama and PostgreSQL modules, and returns appropriate responses.

* **Error Handling:** Comprehensive error handling is implemented throughout the application to gracefully manage issues such as database connection failures, invalid user input, and LLM errors.


## Technologies Used

* **Rust:** Programming language.
* **Ollama:**  LLM interaction library.
* **Tokio:** Asynchronous runtime for concurrent operations.
* **Tokio-Postgres:** Asynchronous PostgreSQL driver.
* **Actix Web (or similar):**  Web framework for building the RESTful API (choice to be specified).
* **Serde:**  Serialization/deserialization library for JSON handling.
